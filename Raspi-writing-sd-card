Taken from http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Flashing_the_SD_card_using_Mac_OS_X official method 2 (commandline)

Insert the SD card into the Mac SD slot

See which device it mounted as:
  df -h
  (mine comes up as /dev/disk2s1)
  
Use diskutil to unmount the device:
  sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk2s1
  
Write the image to the device (note: /dev/disk2s1 above == /dev/rdisk2 below)
  sudo dd bs=1m if=2016-02-26-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/rdisk2
  (if you get permission-denied, the write protect switch is set wrong on your SD card)
  (you can hit control-T in the shell window to see its progress)
  
Eject the disk
  sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdisk2
