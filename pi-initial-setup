Initial setup after 'dd' of clean raspbian image

  login as pi
  sudo bash
  raspi-config
    1. expand filesystem
    2. change user pass for pi
    4. advanced
          set hostname (if desired)
          enable ssh
    5. internationalization
          locale
              pick en_US ISO-8859-1
                  select en_US
          timezone
              pick US/Pacific-New
          keyboard
              pick generic 104-key PC
              other
              english(US)
          wifi county
              US
  reboot
  
  
  Further setup of wifi
   - for some reason the default /etc/networking/interfaces with wlan0 'manual' brings up wlan0
   - edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf to add your ssid and psk ala
          network={
              ssid="myssid"
              psk="mypsk"
          }
    
  Comment out the xconsole section in /etc/rsyslog.conf
    - this is a bug in raspbian that causes lots of nuisance syslog messages
    - simply comment out theh bottom block since by default xconsole is not installed
  
  Take the reboot so wifi and keyboard come up ok
  
  Update to current (long)
   - apt-get update
   - apt-get upgrade -y

  Take another reboot (sigh) just in case

  Install other packages typically used
    - apt-get install -y git vim-nox lsof lynx
  
  scp -r ~/.ssh over from one of the other home systems
    - be sure to clean out known_hosts
